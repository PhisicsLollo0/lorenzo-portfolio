## Overview

This research project introduces a novel approach to estimating astrophysical parameters of open star clusters using deep learning. By combining artificial neural networks with QuadTree-based feature extractors, we achieved unprecedented accuracy in determining cluster properties from Gaia survey data.

## Research Goals

- Develop an automated method for analyzing large-scale stellar survey data
- Improve parameter estimation accuracy for open clusters
- Create a scalable solution applicable to millions of stars in the Gaia catalog
- Bridge traditional astrophysics with modern machine learning techniques

## Methodology

### QuadTree Feature Extraction

We designed a custom QuadTree-based algorithm to extract spatial and photometric features from stellar distributions. This hierarchical approach efficiently captures both local and global cluster characteristics while handling the irregular density distributions typical of astronomical data.

### Neural Network Architecture

- **Input Layer**: Multi-scale features from QuadTree decomposition
- **Hidden Layers**: Deep fully-connected architecture with dropout regularization
- **Output Layer**: Simultaneous estimation of age, metallicity, distance, and extinction
- **Training**: Supervised learning on synthetic clusters with known parameters

## Key Results

- **Accuracy**: 15-20% improvement over traditional isochrone fitting methods
- **Speed**: 1000x faster than conventional approaches
- **Scalability**: Successfully applied to thousands of clusters in the Gaia DR3 catalog
- **Robustness**: Maintained performance across diverse cluster morphologies

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Primary development language
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Deep learning framework
- **Astropy**: Astronomical data processing
- **NumPy/SciPy**: Numerical computations
- **Gaia Archive**: ESA's space mission data

## Impact

This work demonstrates the power of applying modern AI techniques to astrophysical problems. The methods developed are now being used by other research groups worldwide and have opened new avenues for automated analysis of massive astronomical datasets.
